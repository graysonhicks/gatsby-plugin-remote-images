**Note:** This plugin support `gatsby-plugin-image` and drops support for
`gatsby-image` in `3.0.0`.

## Usage

### Install

First, install the plugin.

`npm install --save gatsby-plugin-remote-images`

Second, set up the `gatsby-config.js` with the plugin. The most common config
would be this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-remote-images`,
      options: {
        nodeType: 'MyNodes',
        imagePath: 'path.to.image',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

### Options

| Option Name       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Required | Default      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| nodeType          | The node type that has the images you want to grab. This is generally the title-cased version of the word after the 'all' in GraphQL ie. allMyImages type is MyImages                                                                                                                                                                            | ✅       | `null`       |
| imagePath         | For simple object traversal, this is the string path to the image you want to use, relative to the node. This uses lodash .get, see [docs for accepted formats here](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#get). For traversing objects with arrays at given depths, see [how to handle arrays along the path below](#traversing-objects-with-arrays). | ✅       | `null`       |
| name              | Name you want to give new image field on the node. Defaults to `localImage`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ❌       | `localImage` |
| auth              | Adds htaccess authentication to the download request if passed in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ❌       | `{}`         |
| ext               | Sets the file extension. Useful for APIs that separate the image file path from its extension. Or for changing the extension. Defaults to existing file extension.                                                                                                                                                                               | ❌       | `null`       |
| prepareUrl        | Allows modification of the URL per image if needed. Expects a function taking the original URL as a parameter and returning the desired URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ❌       | `null`       |
| type              | Tell the plugin that the leaf node is an _array_ of images instead of one single string. Only option here is `array`. For example usage, [see here](#handling-an-array-of-image-urls).                                                                                                                                                           | ❌       | `object`     |
| silent            | Set to `true` to silence image load errors in the console.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ❌       | `boolean`    |
| skipUndefinedUrls | This skips undefined `urls` and adds an easy way for the user to implement their own "undefined" values by returning undefined from the `prepareUrl()` function. See [here](https://github.com/graysonhicks/gatsby-plugin-remote-images/pull/134#issue-1568549719).                                                                              | ❌       | `boolean`    |
| mode              | This enables Gatsby ImageCDN support when set to `'cdn'`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ❌       | `null`       |

#### Example Config with Optional Options

However, you may need more optional config, which is documented here.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-remote-images`,
      options: {
        nodeType: 'MyNodes',
        imagePath: 'path.to.image',
        // ** ALL OPTIONAL BELOW HERE: **
        name: 'theNewImageField',
        auth: { htaccess_user: `USER`, htaccess_pass: `PASSWORD` },
        ext: '.jpg',
        prepareUrl: url => (url.startsWith('//') ? `https:${url}` : url),
        mode: 'cdn',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Why?

Why do you need this plugin? The fantastic `gatsby-plugin-image` tool only works
on _relative_ paths to locally stored images. This lets you use it on images
from an API with an _absolute_ path. For example, look at these two response
from one GraphQL query:

_Query_

```graphql
allMyNodes {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        imageUrl
      }
    }
  }
```

_Absolute imageUrl NOT available to `gatsby-plugin-image`_

```javascript
allMyNodes: [
  {
    node: {
      id: 123,
      imageUrl: 'http://remoteimage.com/url.jpg',
    },
  },
];
```

_Relative imageUrl IS available to `gatsby-plugin-image`_

```javascript
allMyNodes: [
  {
    node: {
      id: 123,
      imageUrl: 'localImages/url.jpg',
    },
  },
];
```

If you don't control the API that you are hitting (many third party APIs return
a field with a string to an absolute path for an image), this means those image
aren't run through `gatsby-plugin-image` and you lose all of the benefits.

To get the images and make them available for the above example, follow the
install instructions and your config should look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-remote-images`,
      options: {
        nodeType: 'MyNodes',
        imagePath: 'imageUrl',
        // OPTIONAL: Name you want to give new image field on the node.
        // Defaults to 'localImage'.
        name: 'allItemImages',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Now, if we query `allMyNodes` we can query as we would any `gatsby-plugin-image`
node:

```graphql
allMyNodes {
  edges {
    node {
      localImage {
        childImageSharp {
          gatsbyImageData(width: 400)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or if `mode` is set to `cdn`, we can query with the ImageCDN supported query
like so:

```graphql
allMyNodes {
  edges {
    node {
      localImage {
        gatsbyImage(width: 400)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Many Gatsby source plugins already do this work for you under the
hood. So if you are working with a common CMS's Gatsby plugin, odds are that
_you don't need this!_

## Common Issues

### `gatsby-source-graphql`

Due to the way `gatsby-source-graphql` creates nodes, it is currently impossible
for any transformer type plugin to traverse the data from that plugin.
[Please read this issue for explanation](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/8404).
As soon as that as fixed in `gatsby-source-graphql`, this plugin will be tested
to make sure it works with it as well.

### Traversing objects with arrays

Since some GraphQL APIs will send back objects with nested arrays where your
target data lives, `gatsby-plugin-remote-images` also supports traversing
objects that have arrays at arbitrary depths. To opt in to this feature, add an
array literal, `[]`, to the end of the node you want to indicate is an array.

Given an object structure like this:

```javascript
allMyNodes {
  nodes: [
    {
      imageUrl: 'https://...'
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

To get the images and make them available for the above example, your config
should look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-remote-images`,
      options: {
        nodeType: 'MyNodes',
        imagePath: 'nodes[].imageUrl',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Now, if we query `allMyNodes` we can query as we would any `gatsby-plugin-image`
node:

```graphql
allMyNodes {
  nodes {
    localImage {
      childImageSharp {
        gatsbyImageData(width: 400)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** While `lodash .get` doesn't natively support this syntax, it is still
used to traverse the object structure, so
[the documentation for `.get`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#get) still
applies in full.

### Handling an Array of Image URLs

In case your API offers an image path to an _array_ of images, instead of just
one, there is a way to handle that with the plugin. For instances where there is
an array somewhere along the _path to_ the images,
[see above](#traversing-objects-with-arrays).

For example, you API returns:

```javascript
// MyNode
{
  date: '1-1-2010',
  category: 'cats'
  // Note that here there are multiple images at the *leaf* node where the images are found.
  images: [
    'https://.../image1.png',
    'https://.../image2.png'
  ]
}
```

To make your local image field an array of these images, adjust your config
accordingly:

```javascript
 {
   resolve: `gatsby-plugin-remote-images`,
   options: {
     nodeType: 'MyNodes',
     // Making this plural (optional).
     name: 'localImages',
     // Path to the leaf node.
     imagePath: 'images',
     // Set type to array.
     type: 'array'
   }
}
```

Now, if we query `allMyNodes` we can query as we would any `gatsby-plugin-image`
node, but now `localImage` (or `localImages` as in the example above) we would
get an array of Gatsby images, instead of just one.

```graphql
allMyNodes {
  nodes {
    localImages {
      childImageSharp {
        gatsbyImageData(width: 400)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
